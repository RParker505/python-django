## Exercise 2.8: Deploying a Django Application

### Learning Goals

-	Enhance user experience and look and feel of your web application using CSS and JS
-	Deploy your Django web application on a web server 
-	Curate project deliverables for your portfolio

### Objectives

- Finalize some remaining aspects of the Recipe application, such as (certain) features, content, formatting, and links.
- Write automated tests to ensure that no bugs have been introduced by mistake, or could be introduced when updating the application in the future.
- Ensure the code is well documented and follows best practices. 
- Upload the application to a GitHub repository and host it on a web server to make it accessible to others. 

### Deliverables

#### Step 2: Add Tests
Add tests to your apps to cover the models, views, and forms. Run these tests.

In case of failed tests, fix the bug and run again. Repeat until all tests have passed.
